Inspired by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
and [Orbit](https://withorbit.com)
and [flomo](https://flomoapp.com),
[I](https://xieyuheng.com) also want to create a memory tool.

Some features I wanted:

- Web based.
- Use plaintext to write cards (custom XML for structured information).
- Can share cards, so that people like learning can learn from each others.

Let's call this App **mimor**.

**mimor** `/ˈmi.mor/` adj.: mindful; existing in the memory or mind, known.

- From Proto-Indo-European `*(s)mer-`: to be mindful, remember, take careful thought of.
- Middle Low German `mīmeren, mīmern`: to ponder, reflect.
- Dutch `mijmeren`: to muse, reflect deeply, think to oneself.
- Old Norse `Mīmir`: Norse god of memory.
